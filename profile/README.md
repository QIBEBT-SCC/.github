# About us

Single-Cell Center consists of over 120 specialists from single-cell genomics, synthetic biology, microfluidics, bioinformatics, optical engineering and precision instrumentation. We have introduced novel concepts for single-cell metabolic phenomes such as ‘ramanome’, ‘meta-ramanome’ and ‘MIC-MA’. We invented the Single-cell Analysis Instrument Series, including Ramanome/meta-ramanome Intelligent Analyzer, Raman-Activated Cell Sorter, RACS-Seq, FlowRACS, EasySort, etc., please refer to [http://www.singlecellbiotech.com/](http://www.singlecellbiotech.com/) for more details). We develop single-cell and metagenomics big-data software such as Microbiome Search Engine ([www.mse.ac.cn](www.mse.ac.cn)) and (MP-G)n. These innovations are supporting screening of cell factories, bioresourcemining, marine ecological monitoring, diagnosis of chronic diseases, precision antibiotic administration, cancer drug screening, etc. Moreover, the center develops microalgal synthetic biology (using Nannochloropsis oceanica as a model) for scalable CO2 fixation and photosynthetic production of nutriceuticals and biofuels.
